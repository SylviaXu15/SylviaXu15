## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my space! I’m Lixin (but feel free to call me Sylvia), currently a student at Peking University. I spent an amazing semester at Columbia University and I’m on track to pursue my master’s degree in the US!

I’m super passionate about becoming a QUANT Researcher – I live and breathe data, algorithms, and financial modeling. My dream career? To work at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and finance, turning complex problems into elegant solutions. 🚀

Let’s connect – I’m always up for a fun chat and sharing cool ideas! 🌟
